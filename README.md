Client and Software Requirements:

The client, Artemis Financial, is a financial consulting company that provides personalized financial plans, including savings, retirement, investments, and insurance services. Due to the sensitive nature of financial data handled by Artemis, the primary requirement was ensuring the security of their software application and API. The company needed to address vulnerabilities to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and compliance violations, particularly in international transactions and evolving cybersecurity threats.

Identified Software Vulnerabilities and Secure Coding Importance:

In the assessment, I successfully identified key vulnerabilities, such as hardcoded sensitive data, outdated libraries, and inadequate input validation. Coding securely is critical because it prevents attackers from exploiting weaknesses to compromise data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. Secure coding practices, like input sanitization and encryption, protect sensitive client data, bolster customer trust, and enhance a company’s long term reputation.

Challenges and Helpful Aspects of the Assessment:

The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was conducting the manual review of the code base to identify subtle issues, such as insecure data storage and deprecated functions. However, this process was particularly insightful in understanding how insecure coding patterns introduce risks.

Increasing Layers of Security and Future Tools:

I increased security layers by implementing input validation, encryption, and updating dependencies. In future assessments, I would use tools such as OWASP ZAP, SonarQube, and automated static analyzers to quickly identify vulnerabilities and prioritize mitigation techniques based on their severity.

Ensuring Functionality and Security Post-Refactor:

To ensure the code was both functional and secure, I conducted thorough testing after refactoring. I checked for new vulnerabilities using static analysis tools and performed regression testing to confirm that the fixes did not disrupt existing functionality. This dual approach minimized the risk of introducing new issues.

Resources, Tools, and Practices for Future Use:

The tools and practices I employed—such as dependency checks, secure coding standards, and manual reviews are invaluable for future tasks. Tools like dependency scanners (Dependency Check) and version control platforms (GitHub) will streamline vulnerability identification and collaboration.

Value for Future Employers:

This project demonstrates my ability to conduct a thorough vulnerability assessment, identify critical security issues, and implement mitigation strategies. Future employers can see my expertise in secure software development, as well as my understanding of modern tools, testing processes, and cybersecurity best practices.
